Title : Machine Learning based approach for predicting sealing pressure to achieve IP67 compliance

As a part of my internship work at Bajaj Auto Ltd, I developed an ML model which processes an image of a complex engine and predicts the pressure contour on the surface of the engine, this helps in cross checking IP67 rating and in ensuring no leakage through the engines.
